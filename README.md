A lot of work still needed to be done.

Planning on adding testing, type checking, and refactoring a ton on this. Definitely not going to have data model set up as it is. Just did it this way so that I could easily add stuff to it and have everything all in one place. With how the lesson work is right now, I'm thinking about adding redux or at least a useReducer hook. I think it would be a lot better to have all of the logic live in one place instead of as many as it is. Still thinking about that though.

But this has been a pretty fun experiment so far. A lot of new technologies.
